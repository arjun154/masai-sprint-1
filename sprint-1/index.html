            <p >Chip and Dale are two anthropomotphic chipmunk brothers created at<b>Walt Disney Production in 1943.</b>
                Their names are a pun on the name of the 18th-century cabinet maker and furniture designer Thomas Chippendale.
                This was suggested by Bill "Tex" Henson, a story artist at the studio. Chip is portrayed as being safe, focused, 
                and having a mind for logical scheming. Dale, by contrast, is more laid-back, dim-witted, and impulsive, and has a very 
                strong sense of humor. Chip has a small black nose and two centered protruding teeth, whereas Dale has a large dark red 
                nose and a prominent gap between his buckteeth. Chip is also depicted as having smooth hair on top of his head while Dale's 
                tends to be ruffled. They were given their own series in the 1950s, but only three cartoons resulted under their name: Chicken
                in the Rough (1951), Two Chips and a Miss (1952) and The Lone Chipmunks (1954). The duo was nominated for the Academy Award for
                Best Animated Short Film three times in four years: in 1946 for Squatter's Rights (against Mickey and Pluto), in 1947 for Chip 
                an' Dale and in 1949 for Toy Tinkers (both against Donald Duck).
